# Introduction
The Winter-VLN is a fun racing league, with the goal to replicate the VLN experience as close as possible during the winter season. VLN is a great challenge for the track, but also great multi-class action! The 2020/2021 edition of the league will be our 4th season of action and will be the first time all rounds are broadcast exclusively by RaceSpot TV! It is also the first season which sees the SP3 class dropped due to low interest, however with 4 classes, there will still be plenty of action out on track!

This website will contain the regulations - both Registration and Sporting - for this year's incarnation of the league. It is the responsibility of all team managers and driver's to read through these regulations and ensure full understanding of their contents. The Sporting Regulations apply to all sessions that are hosted by Race Control - including Free Practice sessions that might be hosted during race week.


## Discord Server
All communication from the league organizers will be distributed via our [official discord server](https://discord.gg/fmnnss9). All questions must be sent to our discord server or via a direct PM to a Race-Control official through discord. Please be sure to include your team name and number in the message.

We aim to keep all documents accessible via our website, however we restrict access to most forms such as the attendance forms - these are only accessible in a restricted section of our league. Any additional documents that cannot be hosted on the website will be posted in our Discord!
