# 1. Qualifying

## 1.1 General
1. We will have a 60 minute open qualifying, with all classes on the track at the same time.
2. Race standards apply in a qualifying sessions, and protests can be sent in against poor behavior
3. If a team does not qualify or fails to set a valid time, they will be required to start from the back of your class.
4. To minimize the amount of time spent on an outlap, we will have a special Qualifying procedure. Similar to the real VLN, we will use the shortcut at the end of the GP circuit. You may run the whole out lap if you wish to do so.

## 1.2 Shortcut Procedure
1. As you leave the pit lane watch out for cars on their flying lap & ensure you do not interrupt them. Use your F3 box as needed.
2. Once you are towards the end of the GP circuit you will get to the NGK-Chicane. Align your car with the right hand side of the track as you leave the chicane.

3. Follow the GP circuit and don’t enter the Nordschleife. Stick to the right hand side of the track.

4. Once back on the straight you may accelerate, but you need to stay on the right side until you cross the start finish line.

5. Note: No passing is allowed until the start-finish line, so please remain in single-file!
6. As soon as you cross the start-finish line, you will receive an automatic black flag by iRacing for cutting the course. Your teammate should then request a black flag clearance AFTER you have received the black flag.
7. We use a Discord bot to help Race Control manage black flag clearance requests. The bot is connected to a website where RC can track both requests and see when cars take the shortcut. To request a black flag clearance, use the command “!q” or “!quali” with your car number - e.g. “!q #58”
8. Race-Control will clear your black flag upon seeing the discord message and verifying that you took the shortcut in accordance with the regulations.
9. If you are seen to be abusing the shortcut by taking the racing line, Race-Control will not clear your black flag and will send you a warning message. The short-cut is only intended to allow teams to avoid a long outlap      - if you want the “fastest” start to the long qualifying lap, you will need to take the full outlap.
10. If a car taking the shortcut makes contact with another car that is finishing their qualifying lap, this will result in an automatic back of class penalty for the start and offending teams will not be permitted to compete in the remainder of the qualifying session.
11. There are 59 other cars that will want to clear their flags, so it is possible that you will be missed. Don’t worry if you see that your black flag isn’t cleared after a few minutes. Your time will count, regardless of where you are on track when we clear the penalty.
12. We have prepared a short video to show how the shortcut is intended to be taken.

## 1.3 Solo Drivers
1. Drivers that are driving solo obviously can’t post a message in Discord while driving.
2. Please post your message before you leave your pit stall and add an S at the end of your bot command(S = Solo, e.g. “!q #58 S”). This will give us an indication to wait a few minutes before we can clear it.
3. If you are about to finish your lap and have not received a black flag clearance, you may request a clearance through the iRacing text chat. You can only do this when you are on the Döttinger Höhe and about to finish a lap with a black flag. If you abuse this, your chat privileges will be revoked in the session.
