# 2. Race Start

## 2.1 General
1. We will use a full formation lap to match the real VLN
2. This is done without a pace car, so each class leader is responsible for leading their class and maintaining speed on the lap
3. We will have 2 starting groups separated by 1 minutes.
    - Group 1 - SP9/SP7
    - Group 2 - SP10/TCR

## 2.2 Long Outlap Procedure
1. We will use the iRacing standing start to begin the lap.
2. Once the green flag drops, no-one should move. RC will announce that the SP9 leader can accelerate to 100kph/62mph & instruct all other SP9 Cars to follow in single file.
3. All cars that have not qualified is allowed to pass the rest of the field to rejoin their class when the start group is cleared to start.
4. Race Control will announce when Group 2 is allowed to start. They will be separated by 1 minute from the group in front.
5. The group leader should try to maintain 100kph/62mph.
6. If needed, RC will give instructions through voice chat to make things clear and ensure the grid is in the right order
7. Each class within a starting group will be separated by one empty row to make forming the start formation easier.
8. We will begin the grid formation after the Touristenfahrten Entry on the Döttinger Höhe (long straight). The formation is dependent on class positions.
    - Odd Numbers on the right.
    - Even Numbers on the left.
    - This means the leader starts on the right hand side.
9. Weaving is forbidden once cars have formed the start formation. Cars that weave may be assessed a penalty
10. The group leader will control the race start for the starting group. They are allowed to accelerate at any point after they pass the exit of the Hohenrain Chicane (last chicane before S/F).
11. Cars that try to jump the start or cause unpredictability at the start may be assessed a penalty

## 2.3 Pit Start
1. Cars may choose to start from the pitlane, however, these cars must wait until Race Control makes the pit exit open before leaving the pit lane. Cars may queue up at the start of the pitlane until the pits are declared open
2. Race Control will only declare the pit lane open 1 minute after the last class has crosed the start line for the 1st time.
3. Cars that leave the pit lane early will receive a Stop and Hold penalty corresponding to how early they left the pit lane.
