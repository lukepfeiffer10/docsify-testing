# 3. Team Changes

## 3.1 Making Changes
Changes other than adding drivers must be requested directly to Race Control via Discord. This includes changing cars and updating team details. Changes must be requested by the Team Manager for a team to be considered.

## 3.2 Change Deadline
Change requests must be made by Wednesday 23:59 UTC before each race in order to be applied for a race - this includes team name changes, team id changes, class changes, adding a driver and if applicable, changing car within class (only before round 1 for confirmed teams or before the first race that a reserve team competes in).
