# 1. Entry Requirements

## 1.1 Team Manager
Every team is required to have one (1) team manager who will be the primary person to manage communications and registrations. The team manager is not required to be a driver on the team. This will be the person that registers the team and whose Discord account will be used as the main point of contact

## 1.2 Team Format
1. A team must have at least one (1) driver at the time of registration. You may add more drivers later in the season.
2. A team can have up to five (5) active drivers during the length of the season.
3. Try to ensure you meet the requirements for drivers when first submitting the form. Teams that add drivers via the change request to meet the entry requirements after another team has registered and met the requirements may lose their spot in line.

## 1.3 Race Requirements
1. At minimum, only a single driver is required to participate in any given race and no more than five (5) drivers are allowed to compete in any given race.
2. Solo drivers must have 2000 iRating or higher. If a team finishes a race and breaks this rule, they will be disqualified and risk further penalties.
    - This rule can be waived if you have prior iRacing VLN or Winter-VLN experience. Please contact the league organizers via Discord PM prior to registering to receive approval.

## 1.4 Driver Requirements
1. Only drivers registered for the series are allowed to participate during the official Winter-VLN sessions.
2. Drivers must have a D 4.0 license. We have no restriction for minimum Driver iRating other than as described in the registration rule 1.3.2.
3. Drivers can only be registered under one team. Drivers can change teams during the season by completing the change request form.
4. If you wish to add another driver to the team after registration, you must complete the change request form.
5. Drivers who represent a entry in pre-qualifying are locked onto that entries lineup for the first two races of the season. Other drivers may drive for this entry, but the locked in drivers cannot be switched to another car until Round 3 at the earliest
6. If a entry chooses to pre-qualify with just one driver, they will be unable to add a co-driver until Round 4 (the 6 hour race)   

## 1.5 Car Numbers
We will run fixed car numbers for every session throughout the entire season. Numbers are requested upon registration and are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Please check the Entry List to not take the numbers which are already taken.

We have a fixed range of car numbers for each class:
- SP9 - 1-99
- SP7 - 100-199
- SP10 - 200-299
- TCR - 300-399

## 1.6 Car Selection
For classes with more than 1 car choice, teams are free to switch cars before the start of Round 1 or for cars on the reserve list, before they enter their first race of the season. Once a team has competed in a race, their car selection is locked in for the season and cannot be changed without losing all points earned previously. Teams are free to select any car for pre-qualifying from within their class, even if it does not match their selection on the entry list.
