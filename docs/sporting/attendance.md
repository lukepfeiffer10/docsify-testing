# 5. Attendance

## 5.1 General
To ensure the largest grid size every race, we will ask each full-time team to inform us if they are participating in a race.

## 5.2 Procedure
1. The form will be available through https://wintervln.com for full-time teams to confirm participation two weeks before the race.
2. Team managers have until Sunday 23:59 UTC before a race week to respond
3. If the response is no, that slot will be passed to a reserve team.
4. If the team does not respond, they will be classified as not running and their slot will be passed to a reserve team.
5. If a team does not respond for two races over the course of the season, they will be moved to the back of the reserve list.
6. If a team answers yes on the attendance form, but does not participate in the race without contacting Race-Control, they will be moved to the back of the reserve list.
