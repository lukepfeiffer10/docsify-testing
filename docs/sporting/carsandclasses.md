# 2. Cars, Classes and Grid Size

## 2.1 Cars and Classes

- SP9 - Mercedes AMG GT3 / BMW Z4 GT3 / Audi R8 GT3
- SP7 - Porsche 911 GT3 Cup
- SP10 - Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 / BMW M4 GT4
- TCR - Audi RS3 LMS TCR

## 2.2 Grid Size
1. Max grid size will be sixty (60) cars.
2. To try and keep classes balanced, we will begin by restricting ALL classes to fifteen (15) full season entries upon initial registration.
3. An entry is not marked as complete and accepted as an entry until it has met the entry requirements and has been approved by the league organizers
4. All entries (other than those with invites) must go through pre-qualifying.
5. Teams may still register after pre-qualifying is over and be placed on the reserve list for that class.
6. The series organisers reserve the right to rebalance class size relative to the interest in each class

## 2.3 Reserve List
1. After pre-qualifying, new entries will be placed at the end of the reserve list
3. Reserve list teams will not be allowed to participate in official free practice sessions while on the reserve list.
4. Reserve teams will be notified the Sunday before a race if they will be eligible to race that week.
5. Teams have until Monday night (23:59 UTC) to confirm their participation.
6. If no response is received, that slot will be passed onto the next team
7. If a reserve team answers no, the available slot will be passed onto the next team

## 2.4 Changing Class Mid-Season
1. Teams are allowed to change class during a season
2. Class changes must be requested directly to Race Control via Discord.
3. This change must be requested before Sunday 23:59 UTC before a race week. If not received by this time, it will be changed after the race week
4. Upon class change, a team will be added to the bottom of the entry list of the new class - this includes any existing reserve teams. This means that they would be placed at the bottom of the reserve list, if the class is full.
5. A team that changes their class will lose their position in the class before.

## 2.5 Balance of Performance
1. There will be no BoP enforced in this league
2. There will be no restrictions in tank size
