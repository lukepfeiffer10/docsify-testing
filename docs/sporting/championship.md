# 4. Championship

## 4.1 Overall Championship
1. We will continue with the VLN scoring structure - with a single overall championship. This means every driver races against each other, including across classes.
2. If a driver moves between classes, this does not affect their standings.
3. Drivers can compete in multiple classes across a season
4. Points will be counted per driver, not per team

## 4.2 Prize Money
The Top 3 drivers in the championship will get a small prize. In the case that there is a tie for the positions, prize money will be evenly distributed across the winners.
1. 25 iR Credits
2. 15 iR Credits
3. 10 iR Credits

## 4.3 Points Structure
1. We will use the point structure of the real VLN, with the caveat that all classes will score the same points regardless of how many competitors are racing in that class.
2. The real VLN scoring structure differs from what you have seen before because classes are rewarded with more points for stronger participation. In most series, point allocations are fixed and known but here, point allocations are dynamic; the more cars in your class, the more points you get.
3. To see the official VLN points chart, please visit [this link](https://www.vln.de/en/point-standings/). When looking at the chart, the x-axis represents the number of cars in your class and the y-axis represents your finish position in your class.
    - For example, if your class had 10 cars and you won, you would get 9.50pts but the same win with 20 cars would award you 9.75pts.
4. In order to simplify the whole process and avoid unfair situations that occur with participation across a league season, we will fix each class size at 18. This means that the winner gets 9.72pts, 2nd 9.17pts, 3rd 8.61pts etc..
There will be one drop week to allow for events that cannot be missed
5. In the case of a points tie, we use the number of class wins to determine a winner.
6. If during the course of the season, a single class has more than 18 entries due to unforseen circumstances, points will be recalculated using the size of this class across all rounds.
