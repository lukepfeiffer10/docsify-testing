# 7. Incidents & Protests

## 7.1 Incident Reporting
1. This league will feature live race control - Race Control has the ability to assign penalties to incidents reported via our protest center.
2. If during a qualifying or race session an incident occurs due to reckless, irresponsible or unaware driving, a team has the right to report this incident to Race Control.
3. Teams may submit reports for incidents they were not directly involved in. We encourage all teams to report any incident that would be breaking the iRacing Sporting Code or believe it is a major danger to the rest of the field (i.e. reckless driving, severe lag, etc.)
4. In the event that someone is abusing track limits, defending overly-aggressive on a repeated and consistent basis, teams should report the issue and inform RC of how frequent the issue is. RC will monitor the situation directly
5. All Race Control decisions will be available in real time for all teams via the Protest Center on our league website. Decisions will also be posted in the iRacing Race Control chat as well as the #race-control-decisions chat in our Discord server.

## 7.2 Period of Time to Report Incidents
1. Qualifying
    - Any incident during the qualifying session must be reported before the end of the session - before all cars have crossed the chequered flag to give RC sufficient time to make a decision before the start of the race.
2. In-Race
    - RC will only investigate an incident during the race if the report is made within 30 minutes of the incident. All incidents submitted out of this time frame will be reviewed post-race.
    - Any incident report submitted in the last 30 minutes of the race will be reviewed post-race.
3. Post Race
    - Teams have until 24 hours after the start of the race for the Team Manager to submit a report to the league - this will be done using the normal incident report form for the race. After review, the decision will be announced via discord.

## 7.3 Filing a Protest
1. All reports will be made through the protest center on our [league website](https://winter-vln.azurewebsites.net). A link to the center will be included in the Drivers Briefing. Any other information or communication that might be needed will be done through the league’s Discord Channel.
2. All reports will automatically show in the official Race Control Hub which is available to all teams in real-time, as well as posted real-time in Discord and in-sim through the iRacing Race Control channel
3. Any reports through another means of reporting will be ignored.
