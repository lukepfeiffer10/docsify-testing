# 8. Penalties

## 8.1 Issuing of Penalties
1. After a penalty is issued, the decision will be added to the Protest Center with the time of decision. At the same time, a message will be sent to the penalized team through the iRacing sim informing them of the penalty.
2. Penalty decisions are final and cannot be appealed
3. Once notified, a team has 5 minutes to acknowledge the penalty. The in-sim penalty will be applied after this acknowledgement, or after 5 minutes has passed - whichever happens first.
4. Any penalty that is not served due to either too much damage or parking the car can be applied at the start of the next race at race control’s discretion

## 8.2 Serving Penalties
1. All penalties must be served in your pit stall.
2. iRacing will automatically give an additional 40s time penalty if you choose to get service and serve your penalty at the same time. As a result, there will be no further penalty for taking service and serving a penalty at the same time
3. There is no requirement to take the penalty on the lap you get it - you get 3 laps per iRacing to serve your penalty once it is given in-sim


## 8.3 Penalty Level Table
Here are the levels of penalties that could be issued by Race Control or League Organizers. The penalties are listed from least severe to most severe.
