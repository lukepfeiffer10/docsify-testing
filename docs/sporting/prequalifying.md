# 10. Pre-Qualifying

## 10.1 Pre-Qualifying Schedule
1. Pre-Qualifying will be run over two days with teams being able to choose either day to run
2. Only times from one session will count. If a driver chooses to run on both Saturday & Sunday, only their times from the Sunday Session will be considered in the official classification.
3. Sessions will go live at 3pm UTC on the 14th and 15th of November and each session will run for 4 hours.  
4. Sessions will be available for each individual class to avoid potential traffic issues
5. If needed, multiple sessions will be created for a single class
6. The number of slots available in each class will be confirmed on the 13th of November once all invited teams have had the chance to use their invitations.
7. The results from pre-qualifying will be available on the 17th of November at the latest.
8. Teams can use any car in their class for pre-qualifying regardless of what they choose to enter with.
9. Teams with invites are not permitted to join these sessions to compete. They are welcome to join as a spectator to follow the action if desired.

## 10.2 Pre-Qualifying Classification
1. Drivers may complete as many laps in each individual session as they would like.
2. Sessions will be set up in open qualifying mode for the iRacing Simulator, therefore laps must be completed without incurring any incident points.
3. Teams with multiple drivers do not have to complete their laps in the same session. However, if a driver completes laps on both Saturday and Sunday, only the laps from Sunday will be included in the classification.
4. A minimum of one driver is required to complete pre-qualifying. However, if only one driver completes laps for a team, that team will be unable to add a 2nd driver to their team until the final 6 hour race of the championship. The first three rounds of the championship must be completed as a solo team.
5. For each driver in the team, we will take the best 2 lap run from the session they compete in. We will then average out the best two lap runs for the fastest two drivers in each team. For solo teams, we require two separate runs that will be averaged out as well.
6. A 2 lap run must be run with each lap being completed incident-free consecutively to be counted.
7. For each class, we will then order this average lap time in order to produce the pre-qualifying classification.
8. Teams are expected to respect other teams around them. The track is long enough that there should not be too much of an issue if all teams check before pulling out of pit lane.
9. There will be no manual clearing of black flags in sessions, so teams will be forced to do a full outlaps in pre-qualifying.

## 10.3 Weather Conditions
1. Both days sessions will share the same weather settings and will be setup with static skies to minimize the amount of variation over the course of the sessions.
2. Sessions will be created using Afternoon Time and the following settings:
Temperature: 23C
Humidity: 70%
Wind: 5kph
Clouds: Clear
Track Usage: 100% (marbles will be cleaned)
