# 6. Raceday

## 6.1 Password for Sessions
All sessions will be password protected hosted sessions. The password will be distributed via the Discord server to all confirmed teams at the beginning of race week.

## 6.2 Registration
1. Please make sure prior to registering that the team has the correct car number set. When you register for the race session, make sure you are using the correct team and car.
2. Penalties will be assessed if you register with the wrong team and/or car number.
3. If you register with the wrong car, even in the same class, you will not be allowed to re-register and will not be allowed to race.

## 6.3 Penalties for Registration Infringments
1. The VLN Layout for the Nürburgring-Nordschleife has 60 grid slots. Given that we have a grid size of 60 cars, there is a strong possibility that all available grid slots will need to be used. It is extremely important that teams do not use multiple slots on the grid as this would prevent other teams from being able to register for the race. Should this described scenario occur, an automatic penalty will be applied that moves the team to the end of the reserve list.
2. There are a few possible other registration infringements. These penalties are described in Section 8.3 of the rules.

## 6.4 Qualifying
1. We will have a 60 minute open qualifying, with all classes on the track at the same time.
2. Race standards apply in a qualifying sessions, and protests can be sent in against poor behavior
3. If a team does not qualify or fails to set a valid time, they will be required to start from the back of your class.
4. To minimize the amount of time spent on an outlap, we will have a special Qualifying procedure. Similar to the real VLN, we will use the shortcut at the end of the GP circuit. More information on this is available in the “Qualifying & Race Start” section of the regulations

## 6.5 Race Start
1. All races will use a whole formation lap to match the real VLN.
2. We’ll have 2 start groups separated by ~1 minute.
    - Group 1 - SP9/SP7
    - Group 2 - SP10/TCR

## 6.6 Raceday Communication
1. There should be no communications by any driver during the race through voice chat other than those permitted in rule 6.7. Marshal communications to the drivers will take place via the @racecontrol channel.
2. All teams will have a Discord Voice Channel created for them to use during the race weekend.
3. In the event of any abuse in the “All Teams” or “Drivers” radio channels, RC will disable chat for that driver for the remainder of the race and the team will receive a penalty.
4. Continued behavior like this could result in further penalties for a team

## 6.7 Emergency Race Communication
If you are driving solo and can not get in touch with us via Discord, you may request for RC to join you in your private Discord  by using the “All Teams” or “Drivers” channels. After asking, one of the RC members will join you as soon as possible to help attend to any issues such as filing a protest.

## 6.8 Driving in the Pitlane
When driving through the pit lane, teams must use the fast lane. As you approach your pit box, you may move towards the slow lane and begin to slow down.

## 6.9 Rejoining the Track Surface
Please make sure you are using the F3 black box throughout the race, especially when rejoining the racing surface from a spin, and off track, and/or coming out of the pits. Unsafe rejoins can be penalized. A general guideline to a safe rejoin is to make sure you join parallel to the racing surface and do not cut across the track if possible. Remember you do have a reverse gear.

## 6.10 Escaping to the Pits
1. Escaping to the pits is allowed at any time during the qualifying and race.
2. Please ensure you are not blocking the track and your fellow drivers when resetting - ensure you are off the racing line and in a safe spot.
3. Gaining laps with a damaged car by towing over and over again is forbidden and could end in disqualification.

## 6.11 Fast Repairs
Fast Repairs will be enabled - there will be 1 fast repair available per race. Use it wisely!
